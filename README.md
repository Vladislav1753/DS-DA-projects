# Data analytics/data science little project
Hello!

This is a little project on data visualization, hypothesis testing, predicting with ML model and making some conclusions out of the results we get.

The dataset I'm working with is "Student Performance Factors" that I found on Kaggle. Thanks to the author for it!
